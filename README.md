the heads bugtracker
====================

This is the bugtracker for the heads GNU/Linux libre distribution.
Please use the [issues](https://git.devuan.org/heads/bugtracker/issues)
to report any bugs and other things you find in heads.

You are advised to first search through the existing issues to find if
your specific issue has already been reported. If so, please comment on
it instead of creating a new one, as long as it's the same problem.
